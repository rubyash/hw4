This homework is designed to give you practice working with statistical/philosophical measures of fairness. 

#
The paper linked below^[https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00146-023-01676-3] discusses potential algorithmic bias in the context of credit.  In particular, banks are now regularly using machine learning algorithms to do an initial screening for credit-worthy loan applicants.  In section 4.5.2, this paper reports the rates at which various racial groups were granted a mortgage.  If we assume that it is a classifier making these predictions^[It is unclear whether this is an algorithm producing these predictions or human] what additional information would be necessary to assess this classifier according to equalized odds?

*Student Input*.  

#
Show or argue that the impossibility result discussed in class does not hold when our two fringe cases^[a) perfect predicting classifier and b) perfectly equal proportions of ground truth class labels across the protected variable] are met.  

*Student Input*

#

How would Rawls's Veil of Ignorance define a protected class?  Further, imagine that we preprocessed data by removing this protected variable from consideration before training out algorithm.  How could this variable make its way into our interpretation of results nonetheless?

*Student Input*

Based on all arguments discussed in class, is the use of COMPAS to supplement a judge's discretion justifiable.  Defend your position.  This defense should appeal to statistical and philosophical measures of fairness as well as one of our original moral frameworks from the beginning of the course.  Your response should be no more than a paragraph in length.
